Use the command git init to initialize current folder - it will become a repository.
But you have to make the initial commit yourself, the git wont do it for you.

With the command git status you can see the files in the staging area(waiting for the commit) and untracked files in the repository.

Use the command git add $name_of_the_file$ to add files to the staging area.
